     The monstrous Biglegs have driven the peace-loving creatures of Rainbow Reef from their ancestral homes. Despite their inexperience in the ways of war, Pop and Katch have invented a way of combining their skills to fight back against the Biglegs. For this incredible feat, Pop must bounce from Katch's shell to attack the evil invaders. Katch must then move quickly to save Pop from plummeting into the deep waters below. The cowardly Biglegs often retreat behind coral defenses, so our heroes must be prepared to smash their way through if they are to finally drive the Biglegs from Rainbow Reef!
     There will be no direct control over Pop's movement, and he'll bounce freely around a playing area enclosed by walls on all sides except the base. The left and right arrow keys will move Katch horizontally along the base in order to bounce Pop from Katch's shell and stop him from falling out of the level. The collision point along Katch's shell will determine the direction of Pop's bounce, and so allow the player to control his movement. Bounces toward the left will send Pop left and bounces toward the right will send him right. Pop's movement is also affected by gravity, and each time he collides with Katch, he gets slightly faster so that the game becomes increasingly difficult.
